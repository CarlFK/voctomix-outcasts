# Production

Voctomix is a small set of components that need to be assembled and configured with additional components.  We try to make all of this open and public, but in general everyone needs to define a system appropriate to their needs. For example, not everyone does a live stream so there is no point in expecting a streaming server to be available.

That said, here are things used in production:
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/debconf-video/ansible.git

https://github.com/CarlFK/dvsmon/blob/master/vocto-prod1.py
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/debconf-video/debconf-video.git/tree/src/hdmi2usb/hdmi2usb.py
and I think there are some udev rules around there too.
